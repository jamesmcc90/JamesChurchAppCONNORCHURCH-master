    I love being part of the Church family in Connor because this is a church that really cares about people. Lots of members give of their time to serve Jesus and their community. We do this because we believe what Jesus said about himself: \n "\n "\"I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me."\" (John 14:6)
    "\nWe would love to help you discover this truth about Jesus. If you want to find out more about this good news, please contact us or call in."

        "There are older traces of a religious settlement here but Presbyterian worship here dates from the middle of the 17th century. In March 1658 a Mr Robert Dewart is reported as being on “trials” at that date and as being ordained soon after. Like many others he was deposed in 1661 and his work here ended. The Rev Thomas Gowan of Glasslough supplied the congregation, without being installed, from 1667 to 1671, and then Mr David Cunningham (lic. Antrim 1671) a Scot, entered on trials in August 1671. He was acceptable and was licensed in October 1671, but on account of the intolerance of the period, a public ordination was not attempted. He was, in consequence, ordained privately at Cairncastle on 27 March 1672 with Rev. Patrick Adair presiding.

        For Mr. Cunningham to preach at Connor was also judged injudicious, so he went to Scotland for some months. He returned in July 1672 and the elders on behalf of the congregation received him as their minister. Their welcome was apparently not as practical as it might have been for in February 1674 it was reported that though 'their kindness and dutifulness to their minister was considerable, their quota came not altogether up to their expectation'. Even by 1688 we find their elder, Mr. James Brown, promising the Presbytery that they 'would bestir themselves to get up arrears due to Mr. Cunningham, when victual came into their hands'."

        "Mr. Cunningham’s health declined and he obtained leave from the Presbytery to return to Scotland.

        "He did not do so till March 1689 when the increasing troubles forced him to go. He returned, however, in April 1691 and the Presbytery, three months later, were again promised that “he should receive £30 in hand, and have security of £24, with from eight to twelve bolls (boll = six bushels) of corn yearly. They would also repair his house”. Mr. Cunningham died on 21 May 1697."

        "The Rev. George Alexander Preston of 2nd Castlederg was installed on 10 March 1971, and to the fine church building was added an excellent suite of church halls opened on 8 April 1972.  Mr Preston retired in January 2004 and was succeeded on 28th January 2005 by Rev Richard Martin Murray of Hilltown and Clonduff. Rev Murray’s last service in Connor was 4th September 2016 after he received a call from Drumreagh and Dromore congregations."

        "Rev Philip Thompson was installed as minister of Connor on 28th June 2017 having previously ministered in Waringstown."

The Code of our church lays out the following about Elders:
(1) The permanent officers in the Church are Presbyters (that is elders), who in Apostolic times were also called bishops or overseers, and Deacons. In each apostolic Church there was a plurality of Presbyters: all ruled and some also laboured in Word and doctrine, hence the titles Teaching Elder and Ruling Elder.
(2) The Teaching Elder, who is also called preacher, evangelist, teacher, pastor or minister, in addition to the oversight of the Church which he exercises in conjunction with the Ruling Elders, is commissioned to preach God’s Word, to administer the sacraments of the Gospel and to instruct the people, and is set for the defence of the Gospel.
(3) The Ruling Elder is appointed to watch for souls and to exercise government and discipline in conjunction with the Teaching Elder. This shall include the oversight of the care of those in need and the management of the temporal affairs of the congregation, with the direct responsibility for these two matters delegated to the Congregational Committee.
