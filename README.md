# Connor Presbyterian Church app

This is an Android app for Connor Presbyterian Church. 

It supplements the church's website and social media presence by presenting users, both within and outside of the church, a means (on Android) of communicating with the church via (for example) a real-time group chat. It uses Firebase for a couple of features - for example:

- Remote Config to provide updates on the home screen.
- Authentication via Email and Password and sign-in providers such as Google and Facebook for login to the group chat.

APIs are used to provide a feed of the church's YouTube channel and to present a Google Map pinpointing the location of the meeting house. Likewise, the Google VR SDK will be used to present a 360Â° view of the church interior (currently utilising a placeholder image).
